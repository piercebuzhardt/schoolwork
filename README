Instructions: Run with command line argument for the file .obj as argument 1

Controls:
t: changes transformation to translation
r: changes transformation to rotation
e: changes transformation to scale

depending on what state of transformation, WASD changes effect
translation: wasd moves the object around; w/s for y-axis, a/d for x-axis: perspective moves the camera in this mode
rotation: w/s rotates around the x-axis, a/d rotate around the y-axis
scale: w/s to scale the object vertically, a/d to scale horizontally

v: changes view projection from orthogonal to perspective or back
